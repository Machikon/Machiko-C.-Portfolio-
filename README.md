# Portfolio of Machiko

## Overview
This application was created by following the requirements and mock-up for my class assignment.

## Technologies used
- html
- css

## Features
1. header: it shows my name on the top left, a welcoming photo/image, and links to the following sections.
   * About Me
   * Work
   * Contact Me
2. navigation bar: Each link in the navigation bar will take end-users to the corresponding section.
3. images: when the end-users click on the images, a new browser opens with the image with its URL (where the image originates). 
4. images of different sizes: The first image is larger than the other images.
5. viewport: the view of the page is adjusted when screen size changes - responsive layout.
